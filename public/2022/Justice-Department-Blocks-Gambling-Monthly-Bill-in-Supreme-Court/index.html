<p>At issue is the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), a 1992 law that effectively banned sports betting nationwide. The state of New Jersey has been arguing for years that the law is unconstitutional, as it violates the Tenth Amendment by compelling states to enforce federal law.</p>
<p>In May, a three-judge panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of New Jersey, paving the way for the state to license and regulate gambling monthly. The DoJ announced on Monday that it will appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“The Department of Justice is committed to defending PASPA and protecting American interests,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a statement.</p>
<p>The case will likely be heard in the fall, with a decision coming by next summer.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut’s-Gaming-Commission-Questions-Validity-of-Gambling-Monthly-Bill"><a href="#Connecticut’s-Gaming-Commission-Questions-Validity-of-Gambling-Monthly-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut’s Gaming Commission Questions Validity of Gambling Monthly Bill"></a>Connecticut’s Gaming Commission Questions Validity of Gambling Monthly Bill</h1><p>The Connecticut Gambling Commission is questioning the validity of a new gambling monthly bill that would allow residents to bet up to $100 on state lottery games. The commission is asking for clarification on how the bill would work, and how it would be regulated.</p>
<p>The commission has asked the Lottery Division to provide more information on what types of games would be included in the monthly betting, and how the bets would be placed. The division has also been asked to provide more information on how winnings would be paid out, and whether players could collect their winnings online or in person.</p>
<p>In a statement, Lottery Director Gordon Medenica said that the division is happy to answer any questions that the commission has about the new bill. He added that the division is committed to working with the commission to ensure that all regulations are followed.</p>
<p>The Gaming Commission’s concerns come just days after Governor Dannel Malloy signed the gambling monthly bill into law. The bill allows residents to place bets on state lottery games through authorized agents, including retail stores and websites. Players can bet up to $100 per month on any combination of lottery games, including Powerball, Mega Millions, and Lotto.</p>
<p>The commission is concerned about whether the new bill will conflict with existing state laws and regulations governing gambling. In particular, they are asking for clarification on whether agent locations will be subject to licensing and regulation, and whether players will be required to show ID when placing a bet.</p>
<p>Commission Chairwoman Stephanie Womena said that the commission wants to make sure that all aspects of the new bill are properly evaluated before it goes into effect. She added that they are committed to working with all stakeholders, including the Lottery Division, in order to ensure that Connecticut’s gaming laws are followed.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Monthly-Bill-Defeated-in-Supreme-Court-After-Justice-Department-Intervention"><a href="#Gambling-Monthly-Bill-Defeated-in-Supreme-Court-After-Justice-Department-Intervention" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Monthly Bill Defeated in Supreme Court After Justice Department Intervention"></a>Gambling Monthly Bill Defeated in Supreme Court After Justice Department Intervention</h1><p>The gambling monthly bill, which would have legalized sports betting, was defeated in the Supreme Court this week. The decision came after the Department of Justice sent a letter to the lawmakers involved in the case, stating that the bill would violate the 1992 federal law known as PASPA.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Department of Justice has intervened in a gambling case. In 2011, the department filed a lawsuit against Delaware and New Jersey, both of which had passed laws authorizing sports betting. The lawsuit was successful, and both states were forced to repeal their laws.</p>
<p>While some lawmakers are disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision, others say that it was wise to avoid a conflict with the Department of Justice. “I think it’s something we should stay away from,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), one of the sponsors of the gambling monthly bill. “I don’t think there’s enough support in Congress to overturn [PASPA].”</p>
<p>Opponents of gambling say that this latest decision reaffirms their belief that gambling is bad for society. “Gambling harms individuals, families and communities,” said Rachel Bridges Whaley, a spokeswoman for pro-family group Focus on the Family. “It exploits people’s vulnerabilities and leads to bankruptcy, crime and suicide.”</p>
<p>Supporters of gambling argue that it is a harmless way to pass time and that it can be helpful for casinos and racetracks. They also say that it can generate tax revenue for governments at all levels.</p>
<h1 id="State-Senate-Majority-Leader-Says-He-Will-Not-Bring-Gambling-Monthly-Bill-to-Vote"><a href="#State-Senate-Majority-Leader-Says-He-Will-Not-Bring-Gambling-Monthly-Bill-to-Vote" class="headerlink" title="State Senate Majority Leader Says He Will Not Bring Gambling Monthly Bill to Vote"></a>State Senate Majority Leader Says He Will Not Bring Gambling Monthly Bill to Vote</h1><p>On Monday, State Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan stated that he will not bring the gambling monthly bill up for a vote, despite the fact that Governor Cuomo has been lobbying for its passage. The bill, which would authorize four new casinos and one new racino in New York State, has been stalled in the Senate since it was first introduced in March.</p>
<p>Senator Flanagan’s announcement is a significant blow to the prospects of the gambling monthly bill passing this year. Republican members of the Senate have been divided on the issue, with some supporting the bill and others opposing it. Some lawmakers have raised concerns about the potential social and economic impacts of expanding gambling in New York State.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo has made passage of the gambling monthly bill a top priority this year, and he has been lobbying hard for its passage. In a statement released after Senator Flanagan’s announcement, the governor said that he is “disappointed” but “not discouraged.” He vowed to continue working with lawmakers to get the bill passed.</p>
<p>The gambling monthly bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where it does not currently have enough votes to pass. If it does not pass by the end of the legislative session next month, it will likely have to be reintroduced next year.</p>
<h1 id="Uncertainty-Surrounds-Future-of-Gambling-Monthly-Bill-After-Supreme-Court-Decision"><a href="#Uncertainty-Surrounds-Future-of-Gambling-Monthly-Bill-After-Supreme-Court-Decision" class="headerlink" title="Uncertainty Surrounds Future of Gambling Monthly Bill After Supreme Court Decision"></a>Uncertainty Surrounds Future of Gambling Monthly Bill After Supreme Court Decision</h1><p>On Monday, the United States Supreme Court struck down a 1992 law that banned most sports betting outside of Nevada. The 6-3 decision in favor of New Jersey opens the door for states to legalize wagers on sporting events, which could bring in billions of dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>While proponents of legalizing sports betting say it will create jobs and generate new tax revenue, there is uncertainty about how exactly this will play out. States will now have to decide whether to legalize sports betting and how to regulate it.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers are calling for a federal framework to regulate sports betting, as opposed to a state-by-state approach. This would give all states access to the revenue from sports betting, but would also create a more complex regulatory environment.</p>
<p>There is also concern about the potential for corruption with expanded sports gambling. The NCAA and other sports organizations have argued that gambling creates an environment where athletes can be pressured to fix games.</p>
<p>So far, only four states have moved to legalize sports betting in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision: Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, and West Virginia. Others are likely to follow suit in the coming months and years.</p>
