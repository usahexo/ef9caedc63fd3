        <h1 id="Yankees-sweep-Orioles-inch-closer-to-division-title"><a href="#Yankees-sweep-Orioles-inch-closer-to-division-title" class="headerlink" title="Yankees sweep Orioles, inch closer to division title"></a>Yankees sweep Orioles, inch closer to division title</h1><p>The Yankees completed a four-game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday, and are now one step closer to winning the AL East division.</p>
<p>It was not always easy for the Yankees in this series, as they narrowly won games two and three by scores of 2-1 and 5-4. However, they were able to close things out on Wednesday with a comprehensive 9-3 victory.</p>
<p>With the win, the Yankees moved to within one game of first place Toronto Blue Jays. They also increased their lead over the Seattle Mariners for the top wild card spot in the American League to six games.</p>
<p>“I’m proud of our club,” said Yankees manager Joe Girardi after Wednesday’s game. “We’ve had some ups and downs, but we continue to play hard.”</p>
<p>The Yankees will now look ahead to a crucial four-game series against the Blue Jays, which begins on Thursday night at Rogers Centre.</p>
<h1 id="Blue-Jays-suffer-another-tough-loss-to-Red-Sox"><a href="#Blue-Jays-suffer-another-tough-loss-to-Red-Sox" class="headerlink" title="Blue Jays suffer another tough loss to Red Sox"></a>Blue Jays suffer another tough loss to Red Sox</h1><p>The Blue Jays suffered another tough loss to the Red Sox on Wednesday night. With the game tied at 3 in the bottom of the ninth inning, Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts hit a walk-off home run to give Boston the win.</p>
<p>It was a frustrating loss for the Blue Jays, who had opportunities to win the game but couldn’t capitalize. The team is now 0-6 in games decided by one run this season.</p>
<p>“This is a tough one to swallow,” said Blue Jays shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. “We had our chances, but we just came up short.”</p>
<p>The Blue Jays will try to get back on track on Thursday night when they host the Detroit Tigers.</p>
<h1 id="Rays-put-up-fight-but-can’t-keep-up-with-Yankees"><a href="#Rays-put-up-fight-but-can’t-keep-up-with-Yankees" class="headerlink" title="Rays put up fight but can’t keep up with Yankees"></a>Rays put up fight but can’t keep up with Yankees</h1><p>In what was a closely contested game, the Yankees bested the Rays 5-2.</p>
<p>The Yankees got on the board early, scoring in the first inning when Giancarlo Stanton hit an RBI single. The Rays were quick to answer in their half of the first, as Joey Wendle homered to tie the game at 1-1.</p>
<p>Rays starter Blake Snell was impressive early on, pitching four innings of one-run ball while striking out six batters. However, the Yankees took control in the fifth inning. After back-to-back singles and a walk loaded the bases, Miguel Andujar hit a grand slam to give New York a 5-1 lead.</p>
<p>The Rays staged a late rally in the ninth inning, as C.J Cron hit an RBI single and Daniel Robertson scored on a wild pitch. However, they ultimately fell short, as Yankees reliever David Robertson induced a game-ending double play to secure the victory.</p>
<p>Stanton finished the game 2 for 4 with an RBI and two runs scored, while Andujar went 3 for 4 with four RBIs. Snell took the loss for Tampa Bay after allowing five runs (four earned) over five innings pitched.</p>
<h1 id="Orioles-fall-to-Yankees-as-they-continue-to-struggle"><a href="#Orioles-fall-to-Yankees-as-they-continue-to-struggle" class="headerlink" title="Orioles fall to Yankees as they continue to struggle"></a>Orioles fall to Yankees as they continue to struggle</h1><p>The Baltimore Orioles have had a rough start to the season, and their latest game against the New York Yankees was no exception. The Orioles were shut out by the Yankees 2-0, and they continue to struggle offensively.</p>
<p>The Orioles are now 5-15 on the season, and they are in last place in the AL East. This is not the start that they were hoping for, and they need to turn things around quickly if they want to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>The biggest issue for the Orioles has been their offense. They have scored just 67 runs this season, which is second worst in all of baseball. They have also struck out 258 times, which is third most in baseball.</p>
<p>Their pitching hasn’t been great either, but it has been better than their offense. Their team ERA of 4.89 is 23rd in baseball, but that is still better than their batting average of .237, which is last in baseball.</p>
<p>There are some good hitters on this team, including Manny Machado and Chris Davis. But they need to start producing more if the Orioles want to win games.</p>
<p>The Yankees have been one of the best teams in baseball this season, and it was no surprise that they beat the Orioles on Sunday. But the Orioles need to start winning some games soon if they want to stay competitive in the AL East.</p>
<h1 id="Red-Sox-win-again-extend-lead-in-AL-East"><a href="#Red-Sox-win-again-extend-lead-in-AL-East" class="headerlink" title="Red Sox win again, extend lead in AL East"></a>Red Sox win again, extend lead in AL East</h1><p>Boston Red Sox fans had plenty to cheer about on Wednesday night. The Red Sox won their fourth game in a row, extending their lead in the American League East to 4.5 games over the second place Yankees.</p>
<p>The Red Sox got off to a strong start, scoring three runs in the first inning. Mookie Betts led off the game with a double, and then scored on a single by J.D. Martinez. Xander Bogaerts followed with a home run, and then Rafael Devers hit an RBI double.</p>
<p>The Yankees threatened in the bottom of the first, but Ken Giles got out of the inning without giving up any runs. Giles continued his strong pitching in the second inning, striking out two batters.</p>
<p>The Red Sox added another run in the third inning, when Martinez hit his second homer of the game. This time it was a three-run shot, putting the Red Sox up 6-0.</p>
<p>Giles continued to dominate hitters in the Yankees lineup, and he finished with six strikeouts in three innings pitched. He was relieved by Heath Hembree, who retired the side in order in the fourth inning.</p>
<p>The Yankees finally got on the board in the fifth inning, when Miguel Andujar hit a solo home run. But that was all they could muster against Boston’s pitchers, and they lost 7-1.</p>
<p>This was another impressive win for the Red Sox, who are now 69-30 on the season. They continue to lead the American League East by a wide margin, and they appear destined to make it to the playoffs once again.</p>
