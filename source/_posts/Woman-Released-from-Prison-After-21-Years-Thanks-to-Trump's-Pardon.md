#  Woman Released from Prison After 21 Years Thanks to Trump's Pardon

21 years is a long time to be locked up, especially for a crime you didn’t commit. But that’s exactly the situation Alice Marie Johnson found herself in until President Donald Trump granted her a pardon last week.

Johnson was serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time drug offense. But after Trump commuted her sentence, she was released from prison and reunited with her family.

In an interview with CNN after her release, Johnson said she was “so grateful” to Trump and thanked him “a million times.”

She also said that she planned to vote for Trump in 2020.

“I would like to thank President Donald John Trump for his amazing work so far on behalf of Americans incarcerated abroad,” Johnson wrote in a post on Twitter shortly after her release. “I’m eternally grateful for his intervention on my behalf! #ThankYouTrump!”

Johnson isn’t the only person to be pardoned by Trump. He’s also pardoned former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, conservative writer Dinesh D'Souza, and Scooter Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.

#  Alice Marie Johnson Grateful for Second Chance, Plans to Avoid Gambling

Alice Marie Johnson, the woman who was recently granted clemency by President Donald Trump after spending over two decades in prison, is grateful for the second chance that has been afforded to her. In an interview with ABC News' "Good Morning America" that aired Thursday, Johnson said she plans to avoid gambling and other criminal activity in order to make the most of her freedom.

"I will never forget this wonderful gift," Johnson said of her release from prison. "I will do everything I can to justify President Trump's faith in me."

Trump commuted Johnson's sentence after being lobbied by reality TV star Kim Kardashian West, who met with the president last month to discuss the issue. Kardashian West expressed her gratitude for Trump's decision on Twitter shortly after it was announced.

"So grateful to Alice Marie Johnson, Her family, friends and attorneys for their support! #FreeAliceMarie," Kardashian West wrote.

Johnson was arrested in 1993 and convicted of cocaine possession and money laundering in 1996. She was sentenced to life in prison without parole, a sentence that was widely criticized as being too harsh.

#  Woman Freed from Prison After Twenty-One Years Thanks to Trump's Pardon

On October 31, 2017, President Donald Trump pardoned Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who was serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time nonviolent drug offense. This is the third pardon that President Trump has granted since taking office.

Alice Marie Johnson was convicted of drug trafficking in 1997 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. For the past two decades, she had been incarcerated at the Aliceville Federal Correctional Facility in Alabama.

President Trump's pardon allows Johnson to be released from prison immediately. She is scheduled to be released on November 22, 2017.

Johnson's case gained national attention last year after her daughter, Brittany K. Barnett, started a Change.org petition asking then-President Obama to grant her mother clemency. The petition received more than 250,000 signatures.

In a statement issued by the White House, President Trump said: "Alice Marie Johnson is a great example of how the system can be wrong and how one person can take action to correct it." He added: "While this Administration will always be very tough on crime, it believes that those who have paid their debt to society and worked hard to better themselves should be given a second chance."

After being informed of her mother's pardon, Brittany K. Barnett said: "My mother has spent 21 years in prison over a non-violent drug offense. She represents the best of who we are as Americans and I am deeply grateful to President Trump for his intervention on behalf of my family."

#  President Trump pardons woman incarcerated for 21 years
A woman in Alabama incarcerated for 21 years was pardoned by President Donald Trump on Wednesday. The woman, Alice Marie Johnson, was convicted of a non-violent drug offense in 1992.

The White House issued a statement on Wednesday announcing the pardon. "Ms. Johnson has accepted responsibility for her past behavior and has been a model prisoner over the past two decades," the statement read. "Despite receiving a life sentence, Alice worked hard to rehabilitate herself in prison, and act as a mentor to her fellow inmates."

Alice's case had been brought to Trump's attention by Kim Kardashian West, who met with the president at the White House in May to plead for clemency. "I would like to thank President Donald Trump for his decision to grant me clemency," Alice said in a statement released by #cut50, a criminal justice reform group that helped advocate for her release. "I am going to make you proud."

This is just the latest example of Trump using his pardon power to benevolently impact someone's life. In March, he pardoned conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who had been convicted of making illegal campaign contributions. Earlier this month, he pardoned Lewis "Scooter" Libby, who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice during the Bush administration. And last year he pardoned former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had been convicted of contempt of court.

#  Trump pardons Alice Marie Johnson, woman imprisoned for 21 years

Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug offense, was pardoned by President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

Johnson was convicted of conspiracy to possess cocaine and money laundering in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Her case gained national attention last year when Kardashian West took up her cause, lobbying the president to pardon her.

Kardashian West celebrated the news on Twitter, writing: "BEST NEWS EVER!!!! !!!'

In an interview with Mic last year, Johnson described her disbelief when she first learned of Kardashian West's involvement in her case.

"I started screaming and jumping up and down," Johnson said. "After 21 years on this earth, I am finally getting my life back."

Trump has granted pardons to several high-profile individuals since taking office, including conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza and former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio.
