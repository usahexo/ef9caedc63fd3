#  How to Spot a Stop Card in South Africa

When travelling in South Africa, it is important to be aware of the different stop cards that may be used. These cards are used by the police to stop motorists and check their documents.

There are a few things that you can look out for to help you spot a stop card. The first is that the card will have the word “STOP” written in big letters across it. The card will also be brightly coloured, so it will be easy to see from a distance.

If you see a stop card being used by the police, you should pull over to the side of the road and wait for the police to come over to your vehicle. You will then need to show them your documents, such as your driver’s license and vehicle registration certificate.

If you do not have your documents with you, or if you are not carrying them legally, you could face a fine or even imprisonment. It is therefore important to make sure that you always have your documents with you when driving in South Africa.

#  What to do if You Encounter a Stop Card in South Africa

As a tourist in South Africa, it is important to know what to do if you encounter a stop card. This card is used by the police to stop drivers and pedestrians. The stop card gives officers the authority to question and search individuals. If you are stopped, you should stay calm and obey the officer's instructions.

The first thing you should do is show your ID and visa if you are a foreigner. You should also provide the officer with your travel itinerary and contact information. If you are carrying any drugs or weapons, be sure to inform the officer. You may be asked to step out of the vehicle or accompany the officer to the police station for questioning.

In most cases, officers will just want to make sure that you are not engaging in criminal activity. If everything checks out, you will be allowed to go on your way. However, if there are any suspicions, you may be arrested and detained until authorities can investigate further. It is important to remember that refusing to cooperate with an officer can result in serious consequences.

The best way to avoid any problems is to always follow the law and be respectful towards law enforcement officials. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask the officer. Stay safe and enjoy your time in South Africa!
