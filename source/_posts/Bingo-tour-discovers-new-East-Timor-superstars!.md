#  Bingo tour discovers new East Timor superstars!

A group of intrepid bingo players have discovered a new set of East Timor superstars, according to reports from the tour.

The discovery was made by players who were on a coach tour around the tiny nation, taking in all the best bingo venues in the area. The players, who are all members of a local online bingo community, say that they were amazed by the talent on show in East Timor.

According to the group, the star of the show was undoubtedly Rosa, a player who was knocking them dead at every game she played. Rosa is said to have an uncanny ability to spot patterns and call bingo numbers with great accuracy.

Her skills were so impressive that the group has now christened her “The Queen of Bingo” and they are already calling for her to be given a place in the East Timor national team.

Rosa is not the only player who impressed on the tour – there were also some stand-out performances from Ivo and Mafalda. Ivo is said to be an extremely consistent player who rarely misses a number, while Mafalda is known for her lightning-fast reactions and quick wits.
