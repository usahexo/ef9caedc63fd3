#  Historic 21 3 extreme blackjack Texas Rangers sweep

The impossible dream of the Texas Rangers surged to reality Wednesday night as the team completed an improbable sweep of the tough and talented Baltimore Orioles. The three games played were by no means easy, but with great pitching, timely hitting and a fair amount of luck, the Rangers have justified their place as one of the hottest teams in baseball.

The first game was tight throughout, with both teams scoring one run in the first four innings. The Rangers finally took the lead in the fifth inning on a home run from Ian Desmond. Orioles starter Kevin Gausman was taken out after giving up six hits and four runs in 6 innings of work, including the homer to Desmond.

In game two, reliever Matt Bush started for the Rangers and pitched five innings of scoreless baseball. The Orioles were able to get on the board in the sixth inning off Tanner Scheppers, who was pitching in relief of Bush. Scheppers gave up two hits and one earned run while striking out six batters. The Rangers offense exploded for six runs in the seventh inning; all but one scored with two outs. Rougned Odor led off the inning with a solo home run, then Elvis Andrus and Jonathan Lucroy both singles to load the bases before Carlos Gomez drove them all home with a grand slam. Nomar Mazara capped off the inning with an RBI single that scored Gomez from second base.

Closer Sam Dyson came into pitch the ninth inning for his first save opportunity since being reinstated from paternity leave last Thursday. Dyson walked Manny Machado then allowed a double to Trey Mancini that scored Machado from first base and made it a one-run game. However, Dyson was able to get Chris Davis to line out to third baseman Adrian Beltre to complete the sweep and send Ranger fans into delirium.

The Rangers now sit at 21-3 on their record since May 8th, which is easily their best 28-game stretch in franchise history. They are now only two games behind division-leading Houston Astros and hold at least a share of first place in their division for 37 consecutive days (the longest such streak in MLB this season). It is becoming increasingly difficult not to take this team seriously as they continue proving they are among not just baseball’s best but also its most resilient clubs.

#  Thrilling 21 3 extreme blackjack Texas Rangers victory!

The Rangers had an exciting 3-2 victory over the Astros in 21 innings. This was the longest game in Texas Rangers history and the first game to ever go into extra innings at Globe Life Park.

Adrian Beltre led off the bottom of the 21st inning with a solo home run, giving the Rangers the win. It was his fourth career walk-off home run and second of the season. Beltre is just the sixth player in MLB history with four or more walk-off home runs.

The Rangers were trailing 2-1 heading into the bottom of the 21st inning. Rougned Odor singled to start off the rally, followed by a walk by Elvis Andrus. With two outs, Joey Gallo hit a game-tying RBI single to left field.

Shin-Soo Choo was then hit by a pitch to load the bases, setting up Beltre’s heroics.

This was an exciting game to watch and capped off an excellent series victory by the Rangers over their in-state rivals.

#  Fantastic 21 3 extreme blackjack Texas Rangers season!

In many ways, the 2017 Texas Rangers season was one for the books. It was a fantastic season with plenty of excitement and memorable moments.

The Rangers got off to an extremely hot start, winning 21 of their first 32 games. This included a franchise-record 11-game winning streak to start the season. They only cooled off slightly from there, finishing the year with a 93-69 record and claiming the AL West division title.

One of the biggest highlights of the season came in late September when they staged an epic rally to defeat the Seattle Mariners and clinch their division crown. Down 5-1 in the bottom of the 9th inning, they battled back to score 6 runs and win 7-5. This was an incredible comeback that will be remembered for years to come.

Texas also had some impressive individual performances throughout the year. Nomar Mazara led the team in home runs (24) and RBIs (101), while Adrian Beltre put up some truly staggering numbers at 3B. He led all players in batting average (.315), hits (192), and doubles (44).

Overall, it was an amazing season for the Rangers and their fans. They will look to build on this success in 2018 and make a deep run in the playoffs.
