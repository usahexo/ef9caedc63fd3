#  What is the main goal of the game?

The main goal of the game is to score goals while preventing the other team from scoring. To do this, players use a variety of techniques to get the ball into the opposing team’s net.

# What are the basic rules?

The basic rules are as follows:

- Players must stay within the designated playing area
- The ball can be kicked, thrown, or carried by any player
- The ball cannot be touched with the hand (except for the goalkeeper)
- Players can tackle each other in order to gain possession of the ball
- If a player commits a foul, they are given a yellow card and sent off the field for a short period of time. A second yellow card results in a red card and an automatic ejection from the game.
