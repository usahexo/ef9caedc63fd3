After the big blind has acted, play progresses clockwise around the table.

When it's your turn to act, you can either fold (give up), call (match the current bet), or raise (increase the bet). If you choose to raise, you must raise at least as much as the previous bet. When all active players have either folded, called or raised, the round ends and a new one begins.

The pre-flop round begins with the small blind and continues clockwise around the table. In this round, each player still has five cards and must use two of them to form a hand. The flop round starts once the first three community cards have been dealt face-up on the table. These are used by all players to form their hands. The turn and river rounds follow in the same way, with new community cards being revealed on each successive round.

The showdown occurs when only one player remains in the game. That player must reveal their hand and whoever has the best five-card poker hand wins!
